_"You’ll hear every snap, shriek, and splatter..."_

From weak gasps to gut-wrenching shrieks, Gore Galore gives every injury a voice — and every bone a breaking point!

Featuring iconic screams and crunches from the classic browser game _Happy Wheels_, this mod turns every moment of violence into a full-blown audio nightmare.


**Features:**
- 😫 Randomly assigned screams for every Human character.
- 🍖 Gruesome, layered gore sounds: bone snaps, torso splits, pelvis bursts, chest explosions, and more...

**TODO:**
- 🔉 Make gore and voice pitch scale with character size. (Larger characters = deeper voices; smaller characters = higher-pitched.)
- 🗣️ Assign voices to specific characters. (e.g., in Bob’s Invincible Mod: Invincible sounds like Pogo Stick Guy, The Immortal like Santa, Omni-Man like Irresponsible Dad.)
- 🔊 Consolidate all Context Buttons into a single "Voice Menu."
- ⚙️ Add a Config Menu to toggle/tweak features — possibly using MPW Library.

**CREDITS:**
