_"You’ll hear every snap, shriek, and splatter..."_

From weak gasps to gut-wrenching shrieks, **Gore Galore** gives every injury a voice — and every bone a breaking point!

Featuring iconic screams and crunches from the classic browser game _Happy Wheels_, this mod turns every moment of violence into a full-blown audio nightmare..

## ✍️ TODO
- 🔉 Make gore and voice pitch scale with character size.  
  (Larger characters = deeper voices; Smaller characters = higher-pitched.)
- 🗣️ Assign voices to specific characters.  
  (e.g., in Bob’s Invincible Mod: Invincible = Pogo Stick Guy, The Immortal = Santa, Omni-Man = Irresponsible Dad.)
- ⚙️ Replace the current Settings Menu with a proper one, possibly using MPW Library.
- 🪲🔨 Fix the Limb Crush bug.  
  (Limbs will play their respective crush sound when deleted, even if not crushed naturally.)
- 🔊 Adjust the volume of Voices and Noises.  
  (Some users report they're too loud.)
